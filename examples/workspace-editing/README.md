# `perspective-workspace` client-server editing example

For this example to work, you'll need a `perspective-python` server running
over a websocket at an accessible URL. This example is preconfigured to use
`client_server_edits.py` in `python/perspective/examples`. Make sure you
have `perspective-python` installed, and then run:

```bash
python3 python/perspective/examples/client_server.py
```

Then, run `yarn start webpack` from this example to run the local test server.
