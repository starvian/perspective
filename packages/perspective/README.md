## view

A View object represents a specific transform (configuration or pivot, 
filter, sort, etc) configuration on an underlying [table](#table). A View
receives all updates from the [table](#table) from which it is derived, and
can be serialized to JSON or trigger a callback when it is updated.  View 
objects are immutable, and will remain in memory and actively process 
updates until its [view#delete](#viewdelete) method is called.

<strong>Note</strong> This constructor is not public - Views are created
by invoking the [table#view](#tableview) method.

**Examples**

```javascript
// Returns a new View, pivoted in the row space by the "name" column.
table.view({row_pivots: ["name"]});
```

### delete

Delete this [view](#view) and clean up all resources associated with it.
View objects do not stop consuming resources or processing updates when
they are garbage collected - you must call this method to reclaim these.

### schema

The schema of this [view](#view).  A schema is an Object, the keys of which
are the columns of this [view](#view), and the values are their string type names.
If this [view](#view) is aggregated, theses will be the aggregated types;
otherwise these types will be the same as the columns in the underlying 
[table](#table)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)>** A Promise of this [view](#view)'s schema.

### to_json

Serializes this view to JSON data in a standard format.

**Parameters**

-   `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** An optional configuration object.
    -   `options.start_row` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The starting row index from which
        to serialize.
    -   `options.end_row` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The ending row index from which
        to serialize.
    -   `options.start_col` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The starting column index from which
        to serialize.
    -   `options.end_col` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** The ending column index from which
        to serialize.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)>** A Promise resolving to An array of Objects 
representing the rows of this [view](#view).  If this [view](#view) had a
"row_pivots" config parameter supplied when constructed, each row Object
will have a "**ROW_PATH**" key, whose value specifies this row's 
aggregated path.  If this [view](#view) had a "column_pivots" config
parameter supplied, the keys of this object will be comma-prepended with
their comma-separated column paths.

### num_rows

The number of aggregated rows in this [view](#view).  This is affected by
the "row_pivots" configuration parameter supplied to this [view](#view)'s
contructor.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)>** The number of aggregated rows.

### num_columns

The number of aggregated columns in this [view](#view).  This is affected by
the "column_pivots" configuration parameter supplied to this [view](#view)'s
contructor.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)>** The number of aggregated columns.

### on_update

Register a callback with this [view](#view).  Whenever the [view](#view)'s
underlying table emits an update, this callback will be invoked with the
aggregated row deltas.

**Parameters**

-   `callback` **[function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** A callback function invoked on update.  The 
    parameter to this callback shares a structure with the return type of 
    [view#to_json](#viewto_json).

## table

A Table object is the basic data container in Perspective.  Tables are
typed - they have an immutable set of column names, and a known type for
each. 

<strong>Note</strong> This constructor is not public - Tables are created
by invoking the [table](#table) factory method, either on the perspective 
module object, or an a [worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript) instance.

### delete

Delete this [table](#table) and clean up all resources associated with it.
Table objects do not stop consuming resources or processing updates when
they are garbage collected - you must call this method to reclaim these.

### size

The number of accumulated rows in this [table](#table).  This is affected by
the "index" configuration parameter supplied to this [view](#view)'s
contructor - as rows will be overwritten when they share an idnex column.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)>** The number of accumulated rows.

### schema

The schema of this [table](#table).  A schema is an Object, the keys of which
are the columns of this [table](#table), and the values are their string type names.

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)>** A Promise of this [table](#table)'s schema.

configuration.

        Array values is supplied, a table is returned using this object's 
        key/value pairs as name/columns respectively.  When an Array is supplied,
        a table is constructed using this Array's objects as rows.  When 
        a string is supplied, the parameter as parsed as a CSV.
